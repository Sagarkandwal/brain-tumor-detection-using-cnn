# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based web application for detecting brain tumors from MRI scans. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow and Keras, and provides a simple web interface for users to upload images and get predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects whether a brain MRI scan contains a tumor or not.
- Achieves **95% accuracy** on test data.
- Real-time predictions with **confidence score**.
- Web interface built using **Gradio** and **Streamlit**.
- Clean, user-friendly UI for uploading and analyzing scans.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit, Gradio
- **Backend/Model**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Others**: NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL, Scikit-learn

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 95%
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall
- Trained on a labeled dataset of MRI images (tumor / no tumor)

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. The user uploads an MRI scan through the web interface.
2. The image is preprocessed (resized, normalized).
3. The trained CNN model makes a prediction.
4. The result (Tumor / No Tumor) and confidence percentage is displayed.
